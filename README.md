# HaraGndLink
Custom Telemetry converter adapted for Harakiri TestCode3 and OpenTX 2.1. Needs a Teensy 3.1.

HaraGndLink - Haraki Ground Link
(c) Bamfax 21.06.2015
v0.1 - first ugly draft, still work in progress. Do not use.
Not for commercial use

This is about: Getting a decent and mostly complete telemetry dataset from harakiri down to earth to Taranis, using FrSky RX. 
And to allow having custom sensors in the airverhicle, where needed.

Written for and tested on:
- Harakiri TestCode 3, commit 147
- OpenTX 2.0.99 on Taranis, X4R-sb
- Teensy 3.1

Would not be here without the work from:
- ScottFlys MAVLink to FrSky Telemetry Firmware (http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2274401)
- Pawelsky (http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/member.php?u=393936) and his FrSky S-Port telemetry library
- Crashpilot1000 (https://github.com/Crashpilot1000) and his Harakiri Firmware
- The OpenTX project
- Many others of the Multiwii and FPV community

Compiling:
- Has a bug with Arduino 1.6.4. Hangs while compiling. Use Arduino 1.6.5 and Teensyduino 1.24 instead.
